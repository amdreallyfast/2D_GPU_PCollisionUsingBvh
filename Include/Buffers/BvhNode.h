    If internal, then its children are either leaf nodes or other internal nodes.  If a leaf 
    node, then it will have _data to analyze.

    // wants, but if the GLSL structure contains one of them, then the shader compiler will 
    // expect the buffer that contains those structures to be 16-byte aligned, as if it were an 
    // entire array of the things.  Th Particle structure has a couple vec4's, so it is under 
    // this restriction and the CPU-side structure must be padded to a 16-byte alignment.  If 
    // there are only primitives in the structure definition, like this BvhNode structure, then 
    // no padding necessary.
