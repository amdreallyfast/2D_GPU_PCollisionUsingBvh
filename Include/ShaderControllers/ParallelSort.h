    Description:
        This compute controller is responsible for performing a parallel Radix sort of an SSBO
        according to a structure-specific element.  For example, suppose there is a Particle
        structure with position, velocity, mass, etc.  If I want to sort the particles in 3D 
        space according to a Z-order curve, then I will want to sort the particles by Morton 
        codes.

        Sorting by parallel Radix sort requires going over all the bits in the data to be sorted
        one by one, each time:
            (1) Getting a single bit value
            (2) Performing a parallel prefix scan by work group
            (3) Performing a parallel prefix scan over all the work group sums
            (4) Sorting the data according to the prefix sums.

        If I want to sort the original structures, then I can't just sort by some integer.  I 
        need to associate the data that is being sorted with the original structure.  Enter the
        IntermediateData structure, which stores a uint (data to sort over, such as a
        3D-position-derived Morton code) and the index into the buffer that the structure 
        originally came from.

        This class handles the multiple compute shaders that need to be called at each step of 
        the sorting process.  The sorting process requires knowing how big the original buffer 
        is and exactly which buffer is being sorted, so an instance of this class will only be 
        useful for a single OriginalDataSsbo.  Compute shaders are not as flexible as CPU-bound 
        shaders, so you have to hold their hand, and the consequence is high coupling.

        The benefit is that it can sort 1,000,000 structures in less than 6 milliseconds (at
        least for the OriginalData structures that was ).
        Note: In the GpuRadixSort demo, I could sort 1,000,000 1-integer structures 
        (OriginalData) in ~4.8 milliseconds.  I am now sorting particles, and I can sort 
        1,000,000 particles by position in ~4.8 milliseconds.  Nice!  No perceptable change.
